# YouTube-Channel-Insights

## Project Overview
This project aims to enhance the engagement and effectiveness of government-related YouTube channels through data-driven insights. Using data extraction and exploratory data analysis (EDA), video content trends, audience engagement, and key performance metrics are examined to guide strategic improvements. Future phases will include advanced analytics, machine learning, and deep learning to support data-informed decisions.

## Project Structure
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter Notebooks with data extraction, cleaning, and analysis code
- **data/**: CSV files containing extracted video data
- **src/**: Source code for data processing and analytical functions

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/YouTube-Channel-Insights.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies** (consider using a virtual environment):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run notebooks**: Start with the data extraction and EDA notebook in `notebooks/` to replicate initial analyses.

## Data Sources
Data is retrieved directly from YouTubeâ€™s API for government channels, providing insights on video content, engagement, and trends.

## Future Work
Planned enhancements include feature engineering, predictive modeling, and deep learning applications to derive actionable recommendations for content strategy.
